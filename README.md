About The Game



Hill Climber SFML is a 2D side-scrolling driving game where the player attempts to get their vehicle as far as possible without flipping over or running out of fuel. The game features custom physics for suspension, terrain generation, and collision detection. It also includes a branding new "trick" ability! keep yourself spinning in the air as long as possible and land on your feet to get more score!
